# RNA-Seq-analysis-with-gold-standard-data

This repository contains scripts and commands to perform gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Detailed instructions are provided on how to process the data, perform alignments, quantify gene expression, and perform differential analysis using tools such as HISAT2, SAMtools, bedtools, kallisto, salmon, and DESeq2.

The repository contains the following items:
scripts: combine counts (combine_transcripts.r) and differential analysis (deseq2.r).
refs: reference files, such as the reference genome (genome.fa), gene annotations (features.gff), and transcripts (transcripts.fa).
reads: this directory contains the FASTQ files of the sequencing reads used in the analysis.
idx: indices generated by alignment tools, such as the HISAT2 index (genome.fa).
bam: BAM files generated by alignment tools are stored in this directory.
salmon: quantification results generated by Salmon are stored in this directory.

Instructions for use
Installation of Tools: The analysis requires various tools such as HISAT2, SAMtools, bedtools, kallisto, salmon and DESeq2. You can install these tools using conda/mamba. See the commands in the setup_environment.sh file.

Generate Alignments and Quantifications: Follow the instructions in the script files provided in the repository to run the commands necessary to generate alignments, quantify gene expression, and perform differential analysis.

Differential Analysis: Use the deseq2.r script to perform a differential analysis of gene expression using DESeq2.

Combine Counts: Use the combine_transcripts.r script to combine the counts generated by Salmon into one file.


**This repository is an example for reference and educational purposes. Be sure to adjust them in scripts and commands as needed.**
